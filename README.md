# cucumber
Automated tests using Cucumber for the Breeds API (available at https://catfact.ninja/)

To build and run my tests I used maven wrapper (https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/)

For building --> ./mvnw clean install

For running the tests --> ./mvnw test

For opening the project in IntelliJ IDEA --> Select the pom.xml and open it as a project
